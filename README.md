  - Sends back a **JWT token in a cookie**.
- Token is checked on all admin routes using middleware.
- If token is invalid or missing ‚Üí access is denied.
- Logout simply clears the token cookie.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Image Hosting with Cloudinary

- All image uploads (profile, project screenshots) are handled with `multer` on the backend.
- Images are **uploaded to Cloudinary**, not stored locally.
- Cloudinary returns a secure URL which is saved in MongoDB and used to display images on the frontend.

‚úÖ This means your site can load images faster and doesn't depend on your server storage.
